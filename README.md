# Rescue Robot Simulation
Project 1 - Load a Rescue Robot Simulation File (This one is too easy so I do not post it.)

Project 2 - An Object-Based Model-View-Controller World

Project 3 - Expand the Simulation with a Class Hierarchy

Project 4 - Add Time and Object Interaction to the Simulation

The course is structured around a number of important programming concepts, as follows: Problem decomposition, structured programming, files manipulation, exceptions, inheritance, object-oriented programming, namespaces and scope, testing and debugging, and possibly event-driven programming and graphical-user interface programming. 

Model data: World, Human, Waypoint, Robot, Fire Flames (with strength level)
Action command: create, show (show view), status (print the data and their position), go (execute the commands one step above and time goes), move, (robot) attack (fire)

Two example ouput file of project 4:

File 1:
( Show how do the basic orders and make robot/human move:)

File 2:
(show one more function that robot extinguish fire)
