# Rescue Robot Simulation
Project 1 - Load a Rescue Robot Simulation File (This one is too easy so I do not post it.)
Project 2 - An Object-Based Model-View-Controller World
Project 3 - Expand the Simulation with a Class Hierarchy
Project 4 - Add Time and Object Interaction to the Simulation

The course is structured around a number of important programming concepts, as follows: Problem decomposition, structured programming, files manipulation, exceptions, inheritance, object-oriented programming, namespaces and scope, testing and debugging, and possibly event-driven programming and graphical-user interface programming.
